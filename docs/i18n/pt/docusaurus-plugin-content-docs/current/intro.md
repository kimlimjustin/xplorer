# Xplorer

## Sumário

Bem vindo ao Xplorer, Um Explorador de Arquivos de Código Aberto e Grátis (FOSS).

Xplorer is a file explorer built from ground-up to be fully customizable. And even without any customization, it already looks modern!

Xplorer is a cross-platform application built using [Tauri](https://tauri.studio), and you can run it on Windows, MacOS, or Linux without having much trouble. One of the key feature is Xplorer allows you to preview the files you have directly inside Xplorer. And it's not only limited to picture or document preview, but also video preview.

To summarize, Xplorer's features contain:

-   It looks modern
-   Fácil de usar
-   Multi-plataforma
-   [File Preview](https://xplorer.space/docs/guides/operation/#preview-file), even for videos!
-   Customizable
-   Supports multiple tab
-   Most importantly, Free and Open Source Software(FOSS), which means you can change components inside if you see fit
